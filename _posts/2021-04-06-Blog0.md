### Blog Goal: tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set


1. To visualize the Palmer Penguins data, we first read the data into Python with the following commands to import necessary tools:
	- we first **import pandas**, the data visualization and analysis package 
	- we import **matplotlib**, the package to plot 
	- we import **seaborn**, the package with a bunch of matplotlib shortcuts 
```python
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 
```
2. We then write down the url of the data base, and use the **read_csv** command in pandas package to read the csv sheet from the url source. Then run the following command to check the data we import:
	- to see the data shape, we can use the command **.shape** to ***see the number of rows and columns of the data***
	- to get a sense of how the data look slike, use the command **.head()** to ***see the first five rows of data***
```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins.shape
penguins.head()
```
    - the ouput will look like this:
3. We then observe the data and can see that some columns, such as Sex, have **NaN** values instead of numerical values.These NaN values stand for Not a Number, which impedes our data visualizaiton. So we should use **.dropna** command to ***drop the rows that contain NaN value in the columns we specify***. 
	- For instance, we can run the following commands to drop the rows that contain NaN values in Sex, Delta 15 N (o/oo), Delta 13 C (o/oo)
	- We can use .shape again to see the shape of data after deleting unnecessary rows.
```python
penguins.dropna(subset = ["Sex"],inplace = True)
penguins.dropna(subset = ["Delta 15 N (o/oo)"],inplace = True)
penguins.dropna(subset = ["Delta 13 C (o/oo)"],inplace = True)
penguins.shape 
```
4. Then we can start doing basic data visualization.We can ***specify the data we want for specific requirements***. 
	- For instance, we only want the data such that penguins' Clutch Completion has finished. Then this line of command will give us the data that satisfy our needs.
```python
penguins[penguins["Clutch Completion"] == "Yes"]
```
	- Then, we can declare this set of data to be set1 for convenient use
	- We now use **lineplot** command in seaborn package to ***plot line graph***. This kinds of lines allows us to see *the trend/relationship between two variables*. For instance, if we want to see for the penguins who complete clutch whether there is a implication between their Body Mass and their Culmen Length, we can set Body Mass to be the x-variable and Culmen Length as y-variable. Then use the lineplot command to plot the graph. We run the following command:
```python
set1 = penguins[penguins["Clutch Completion"] == "Yes"]
sns.lineplot(data = set1, x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Culmen Length (mm)")
```
	- the result will look like this:![p1.png](/images/p1.png)
5. Similarly, we can try the following command to see another possible implication for another subset of penguins data:
```python
set2 = penguins[penguins["Island"] == "Torgersen"]
sns.lineplot(data = set2, x = "Culmen Depth (mm)", y = "Culmen Length (mm)")
```
	- the result will look like this:![p2.png](/images/p2.png)
	
### Now We may want to do something more, such as seeing implications between two variables from multiple species in one graph.

1. To gain a better sense of data, we can use **set_index** command for dataframe objects(here is the *penguins*) where we *specify the keys to be the index*:
```python
penguins = penguins.set_index(keys = ["Species","Island","Body Mass (g)","Culmen Length (mm)"])
```
2. Since we may not need certain columns that do not contribute to our data visualization, we use **.drop()** command for data frames to drop specified columns:
```python
smallset = penguins.drop(["studyName", "Individual ID","Comments","Sample Number","Region"],axis = 1)
```
3. We can now use **.stack()** to *put information together in one column and python will group them by index*. We followingly use **.reset_index()** to turn the index columns into *regular columns* for plotting purposes. The commands are:
```python
smallset = smallset.stack()
smallset = smallset.reset_index() 
```
4. We are more ready to make plots. First, we can divide the body mass by 100 to get smaller units of numbers for easier views. By using **groupby**, we *group the data according to the specified columns*.
```python
averages = smallset.groupby(["Species","Culmen Length (mm)"])[["Body Mass (g)"]].mean()/100
averages = averages.reset_index()
averages.head()
```
5. Now we are ready to plot with data that we have. We still use the lineplot command in seaborn. We specify the **data set, x variable, y variable, hue**.
	- for instance, if we want to the the implication between body mass and culmen length, we can run similar command as above. Then we can adjust the legends by specifying certain numbers, but this is not that kind of important in starting data visualization.
	- we will run the following command:
```python
sns.lineplot(data = averages, 
             x = "Body Mass (g)", 
             y = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
             hue = "Species")
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1),loc=2)
plt.savefig("pd-1-example-plot.png", bbox_inches = "tight")
```
	- the result will look like this:![p3.png](/images/p3.png)
	- we can also *specify a particular species* that we want to look like:
		- we first use **averages["Species"].str[0] == "A"** which will give us a *boolean result* that is True or False. This command gives the result of whether the name of Specieas begin with letter A.
		- we then use **averages[averages["Species"].str[0] == "A"]** which will return us the filtered data where averages["Species"].str[0] == "A" gives True.
```python
begins = averages[averages["Species"].str[0] == "A"]
```  
	- then the following things will be similar to plot
	- the commands will be:
```python
sns.lineplot(data = begins, 
             x = "Body Mass (g)", 
             y = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
             hue = "Species")
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1),loc=2)
plt.savefig("pd-1-example-plot.png", bbox_inches = "tight")
```
