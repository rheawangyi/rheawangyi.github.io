	$$ f(x) = e^x $$

Talking about Python code:
 - on the top left of key board
 - add python after the three backsticks will highlight code

```python
def f(x):
	"""
	a cool function that multiplies an input by 3 
	"""
	return 3*x
```

I LEARNED SOMETHING


```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1001)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
```
